        <p>
            Your food choices each day affect your health â€” how you feel today, tomorrow, and in the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            Good nutrition is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. Combined with physical activity, your diet can help you to reach and maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of chronic diseases (like heart disease and cancer), and promote your overall health.

        <h3>Why Having a Healthy BMI Matters</h3>
        <p>Is BMI just another number to keep track of? Not exactly. It can be useful in telling you whether your weight is in a healthy spot, and it also clues you in when you may be at risk for various health conditions because your BMI has fallen outside the normal range.
          <br />
          <br />
            A BMI of 30 or higher, for instance, means you qualify as obese, which can lead to:
            <br />
            -High blood pressure
            <br />
            -High cholesterol
            <br />
            -Body pain
            <br />
            -Stroke
            <br />
            -Heart Disease
            <br />
            -Type 2 Diabetes
