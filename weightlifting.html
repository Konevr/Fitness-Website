        <h3>The 4 things that will happen when you start Weightlifting</h3>

        <h4>You'll feel great</h4>
          <br />
            <p>This point comes first because it’s so important, yet is often overlooked when people are considering the various ways to keep healthy. Weightlifting makes you feel amazing!</p>
          <br />
            <p>When you lift weights you’ll feel great for two reasons: making progress and clearing your head.</p>
          <br />
            <p>The aim of weightlifting is progressive as you strive to get stronger and stronger, and with constant practice and good nutrition you bear witness to your evolving ability to lift heavier weights. There’s really nothing like the feeling of smashing through a target weight goal.</p>
          <br />
            <p>Many people who weight lift also describe a feeling of ‘heightened awareness’ which is simply your body’s way of letting you know you’re more alert. Lifting weights releases endorphins for hours on end after each session, making you feel amazing.</p>
          <br />
        <h4>Your balance and posture will improve</h4>
          <br />
            <p>When training with weights your body adapts itself to new stresses, and part of this process sees the recruitment of things called ‘motor neurons’.</p>
          <br />
            <p>Without getting too technical, motor neurons are the nerves responsible for movement. They are essentially connected to your muscle fibres, and they send signals to the muscles to tell them to move. These neurons are further bundled up into bunches called ‘motor units’ which, if you’ve never heard of them, are like a big spindle of neurons, all connected to lots of muscle fibres.</p>
          <br />
            <p>As we weight train, we force our body to adapt to strain, and this in turn means that more of our motor units start to ‘fire’ more often, basically making us stronger. We call this ‘motor unit recruitment’.</p>
          <br />
            <p>If you imagine it like a tug of war between you and the weight - the more people you get to help out on your side, the more likely it is you’ll win. This is the same principles when recruiting more motor units!</p>
          <br />
            <p>Over time through regular weight training, your body will get much better at activating more of these motor units, which is pretty cool because the more you are able to activate, the better all of your muscles ‘work’.</p>
          <br />
            <p>This has a big impact on your ability to balance better, and your ability to ‘hold yourself up’ - i.e. stand better.</p>
          <br />
            <p>After a few weeks of weight training, just see how much better you are at balancing on that crowded tube!</p>
          <br />
        <h4>You'll get better at moving</h4>
         <br />
            <p>Directly related to our last point, when you have more motor units working hard every day, you simply get better at doing normal movements like walking and bending down!</p>
         <br />
            <p>It’s an amazing feeling to realise the potential of your everyday movements, and how much confidence this exudes to people around you. It’s easy to think that weight training doesn’t help you with the mundane things, but it definitely does.</p>
          <br />
        <h4>You'll get stronger</h4>
          <br />
            <p>We’ve left the most obvious one until last: lifting weights makes you stronger!</p>
          <br />
            <p>But strength isn’t the only thing to take away from lifting; everyday tasks like opening doors, picking the kids up, and building flat pack furniture will be performed with more ease.</p>
          <br />
            <p>It’s nice to be stronger, and in the process you’ll make yourself more useful on a daily basis!</p>
          <br />
            <p>We’d love to hear from you - what are some of the ways weightlifting has benefited you? Leave a comment or get in touch on social media.</p>

              <strong>Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) Workout</strong>
            </p>
            <br />
              <p>The PHUL workout is based around the basic principles of strength and size. This 4 day program will allow you to maximize results on both fronts in an easy adaptable routine built off the following principles:</p>
            <br />
              <p><strong>Frequency</strong>. Studies have shown muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to be elevated for up to 48 hours after training. That would make it ideal for you to hit each muscle more frequently than a typical once per week split. The PHUL program is designed to hit each muscle group twice within a week.</p>
            <br />
              <p><strong>Compounds</strong>. The PHUL program focuses on the big compound movements for optimal progression. While isolation movements are included in this program as well, the main goal is to increase performance on the main lifts, as well as pack on pounds of muscle.</p>
            <br />
              <p><strong>Power</strong>. This program uses 2 of it's 4 working days to focus on pure strength training. The key to getting stronger and bigger is to utilize progressive overload and time under tension. These 2 days will see that you'll be able to use more weight on your hypertrophy days.</p>
            <br />
              <p><strong>Hypertrophy</strong>. In addition to 2 power days, your other 2 days on the PHUL program will focus on hypertrophy bodybuilding style training. This way, not only will you be seeing strength increases but you'll be building size as well.</p>
            <h4>
              <br />
              PHUL Notes:
            </h4>

                <ol><li>
                    <strong>Sets and Reps</strong> - When first beginning this program it is suggested to start with a lower amount of total volume until you become accustomed to the workload.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Failure</strong> - Failure is a tool that should not be abused. All sets should be completed with at least 1 rep "left in the tank." Meaning you should struggle to complete your heavier sets, but not to the point where you're unable to get your goal reps.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exercise Selection</strong> - Main compounds should remain unchanged, however substitutions can be made for like exercises if desired.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Abdominals</strong> - Ab work can be done at the end of training or on off days.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>
                    PHUL Schedule:</h4>
